# HOG-Pedestrian-Detection

This project is to use histogram of oriented gradients method to detect the pedestrian shown in the video and draw a bounding box around the pedestrian. It will first clone the dataset from the repository, and show you how HOG works using a sample image. Then it uses two type of datasets to train the model, one is positive samples (human image), and the other is negative samples (non-human image). The dataset will split into 80/20 to test the performance of the model. Last section it will input a video to detect the pedestrian on the street.

Note: The ipynb file may contains some bugs, and the print output process is running infinitely so it may run out of memory.

##This project is only for assignment purpose.
